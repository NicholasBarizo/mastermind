# Mastermind Project
During this project I tried to focus on dividing my code into appropriate methods. I struggled with abiding by the robocop which suggests keeping methods under 10 lines. I ended up doing most of the method creation once the code was already fully written out in larger methods. I now see an important benefit in pseudocoding first, which is that you are able to properly organize your methods before they become convoluted and difficult to manage.
